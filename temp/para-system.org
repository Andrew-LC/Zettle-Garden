#+Title: PARA Method

"*the ultimate system for organizing your life is one that is actionable."*

The system is basically:

- *Projects*:
Things you need to complete currently and stuff your'e working on at the moment to be accurate.

- *Areas*:
These are ongoing and you need to take care of them for a very long time. e.g health, personal development etc.

- *Resources*:
Topics, things, that you find interesting

Organize information on the basis of goals and actions, organizing them on the basis of subject makes no sense.
