#+title: Algorithm Analysis

We can assess an algorithms efficiency using two tools:
1. RAM Model
2. Asymptotic analysis

The RAM model simplifies what happens when you run the algorithm and makes it easier to understand the efficiency of the model.
Example the accepted fact is that the earth is oval in shape but the flat model is quite effective when we build houses and etc.

The model states:
+ Every operations take only one step
+ Loops and subroutines are compositions of steps
+ Every memory access takes one step


+ Time complexities are numerical functions representing time vs problem size.

+ It is much easier to think about the worst case.

+ Thinking in upper bound and lower bound is more useful, e.g we want to know how bad or good the algorithm runs compared to the average case.

+ Nested iterations are mutliplied with each other e.g two for loops inside each other has nxn.
