#+Title: C Programming 


** Chapter 6 - Loops

A loop is a statement whose job is to repeatedly execute some other statement (the loop body). In C, every loop has a controlling expression. Each time the loop body is executed (an iteration of the loop), the controlling expression is evaluated;
if the expression is true—has a value that’s not zero—the loop continues to execute.

*Types of Loops*
- While
- Do while
- For

** Chapter 7 - Basic Types
*** Character
- The values of type char can vary from one computer to another, because different machines may have different underlying character sets.

- Characters use single quotes and not double quotes. 

- A single character is treated as a small integer.

 #+begin_src c 
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <stdlib.h>


   int main()
   {
     char a = 'a';
     for(int i = 0; i < 26; i++){
       printf("%c\n", (char)((int)a + i));
     }

     printf("============EOF==============\n\n");

     for (char i = 'a'; i <= 'z'; ++i) {
       printf("%c : %10d\n", i, (int)i);
     }

     return 0; 
   }
#+end_src

- The compiler doesn't read 'a', 'b' etc, it reads the binary reprsentation of the character.(very interesting)


** Chapter 10 Program Organization 

- Local Variables have *automatic storage duration*, they're allocated automatically and don't retain their last value.
- It is block scoped meaning it is available everywhere inside the function.
